# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added one Pi extension tool, `visual_explainer`, with `prepare` for permission-aware visual explanation planning and optional subagent scouting, plus `render` for writing and opening generated HTML pages while keeping `/generate-web-diagram` as a prompt template.

### Changed
- Compressed the visual-explainer skill and command prompts from 10,824 words to 2,131 words, an 80%+ reduction in prompt tokens, while preserving the hard rendering, Mermaid, table, slide, and review-section requirements.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-27

### Compatibility
- Added first-class Pi package metadata so `pi install` can load the canonical `plugins/visual-explainer/` skill and command templates directly from the repo.
- Preserved the Claude Code marketplace layout while synchronizing package and plugin manifest versions to `0.7.1`.
- Added lightweight harness guidance for Pi, Codex CLI, OpenCode/opencode, Cursor, and OpenClaw without duplicating skill directories or adding runtime adapters.
- Documented migration cleanup for older manual Pi installs, which can otherwise shadow package resources with copied user-level skill and prompt files.

### Changed
- Made `pi install` the primary Pi installation path while keeping the legacy installer documented as an explicit copied-file alternative.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-09

### Documentation
- Added explicit warning against using bare `<pre class="mermaid">` tags — they render but produce tiny unusable diagrams without zoom/pan controls. Updated SKILL.md to point to the full `diagram-shell` pattern from `templates/mermaid-flowchart.html`.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-08

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed fullscreen diagram export using wrong background color — now uses the same dark/light mode that was used to render the Mermaid theme

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-08

### Pi Install Script
- New `install-pi.sh` for one-command installation
- Automatically patches `{{skill_dir}}` to actual install path
- Usage: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer/main/install-pi.sh | bash`

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-08

Based on PR #25 by [@peak-flow](https://github.com/peak-flow), with additional multi-diagram architecture and bug fixes.

### Multi-Diagram Support
- New vector-based zoom/pan engine replacing CSS `zoom` with direct SVG sizing
- Closure-based `initDiagram(shell)` pattern — per-diagram state in closures, shared drag listeners at module scope
- Unlimited diagrams per page with no ID collisions (each diagram gets a unique generated ID)
- New HTML structure: `.diagram-shell` > `.mermaid-wrap` > `.mermaid-viewport` > `.mermaid-canvas`
- Source Mermaid code lives in `<script type="text/plain" class="diagram-source">` to avoid parsing issues
- Adaptive viewport height based on diagram aspect ratio
- Smart fit algorithm with readability floor (prevents tiny unreadable diagrams)
- New zoom controls: 1:1 button, zoom percentage label
- Touch pinch-to-zoom support with proper pan transition
- Double-click to fit diagram

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed touch pinch→pan transition (reset start coords after pinch ends)
- Removed dead `fitZoom` variable from previous implementation
- Removed 12 lines of dead scrollbar CSS (no longer needed with new viewport approach)

### Documentation
- Updated `css-patterns.md` with new multi-diagram structure and JavaScript pattern
- Simplified Mermaid section to reference `mermaid-flowchart.html` as canonical source

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-05

### Claude Code Marketplace Structure
- Restructured repo to follow Claude Code's official plugin marketplace spec
- Moved all skill files into `plugins/visual-explainer/` subdirectory
- Added `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` catalog for marketplace discovery
- Plugin manifest now at `plugins/visual-explainer/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Install via marketplace: `/plugin marketplace add nicobailon/visual-explainer` then `/plugin install visual-explainer@visual-explainer-marketplace`

### Pi Manual Install
- Replaced `pi install` one-liner with manual installation instructions
- Pi users now clone repo and copy skill + prompts to `~/.pi/agent/skills/` and `~/.pi/agent/prompts/`
- Removed stale `pi` field from `package.json` (was pointing to non-existent root paths)

### OpenAI Codex Install Fix
- Fixed prompts path: `~/.codex/prompts/` (was incorrectly `~/.agents/commands/`)
- Prompts are optional (deprecated feature) — skill works without them via `$visual-explainer`
- With prompts installed, invoke as `/prompts:diff-review`, `/prompts:plan-review`, etc.

### Breaking Changes
- Direct Claude Code plugin install (`/plugin install https://...`) no longer works — use marketplace flow instead
- `pi install https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer` no longer works — use manual install

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-04

### Class Diagram and C4 Architecture Support
- Added `classDiagram` guidance for OOP design and domain modeling
- Documented relationships: association, composition, aggregation, inheritance
- Added C4 architecture support using `graph TD` + `subgraph` (not native `C4Context` which ignores themes)
- Added `.dir-tree` CSS pattern for file structures with tree connectors
- Added quick-reference table for choosing Mermaid diagram types

### Claude Code Plugin Support
- Added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest for Claude Code plugin installation
- Renamed `prompts/` to `commands/` (compatible with both pi and Claude Code)
- Claude Code: `claude /plugin install https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer`
- Note: Claude Code namespaces commands as `/visual-explainer:command-name`

### OpenAI Codex Support
- Added install instructions for OpenAI Codex to README
- Uses `~/.agents/skills` and `~/.agents/commands` paths

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed pi skill loading: scoped `pi.skills` to `./SKILL.md` instead of `./` (was trying to load README.md and CHANGELOG.md as skills)
- Fixed Mermaid line breaks: use `<br/>` instead of `\n` in flowchart labels (renders as literal text otherwise)
- Fixed `mermaid-flowchart.html` to match documented pattern: moved flex centering from `.mermaid-wrap .mermaid` to `.mermaid-wrap`, added `min-height: 400px`

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-04

### Click-to-Expand Mermaid Diagrams
- Clicking anywhere on a Mermaid diagram (without dragging) opens it full-size in a new browser tab
- Added expand button (⛶) to zoom controls for discoverability
- New `openMermaidInNewTab()` and `openDiagramFullscreen()` functions in the Mermaid JavaScript pattern
- Click detection distinguishes quick clicks from drag-to-pan (5px movement threshold, 300ms time threshold)
- Full-size view preserves the page's background color for visual consistency
- Updated all templates (`mermaid-flowchart.html`, `slide-deck.html`) with new pattern
- Updated `css-patterns.md` and `slide-patterns.md` documentation

### Bug Fixes
- Removed unused `text` variable in `openMermaidInNewTab()` function
- Removed unused `e` parameter in mouseup handlers
- Fixed inconsistent zoom range limits (standardized to 0.5x–5x across all files)
- Removed dead CSS `.mermaid-wrap.is-zoomed` rule (class was never applied by JavaScript)
- Removed dead CSS `transition: transform` on `.mermaid` (zoom property is not animatable)
- Added missing `cursor: grab` to base `.mermaid-wrap` selector in templates
- Added missing flex centering (`display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center`) to `.mermaid-wrap` in `slide-deck.html`
- Updated `SKILL.md` to explicitly mention the click-to-expand feature and expand button so agents include it when generating pages
- Updated all prompt templates (`diff-review.md`, `plan-review.md`, `project-recap.md`, `generate-visual-plan.md`) to specify the expand button and click-to-expand functionality for Mermaid diagrams

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-01

### Mermaid Zoom and Positioning Fixes
- **Fixed zoom clipping**: Replaced `transform: scale()` with CSS `zoom` property. Transform only changes visual appearance — content expanding upward/leftward goes into negative space which can't be scrolled to. Zoom changes actual layout size, so overflow scrolls normally in all directions.
- **Fixed vertical centering**: Changed `align-items: flex-start` to `align-items: center` so diagrams are centered both horizontally and vertically in their container.
- **Added initial zoom**: Complex diagrams can start at zoom > 1 (e.g., 1.4x) for better readability while keeping zoom controls functional.
- **Added min-height**: Containers now have `min-height: 400px` to prevent vertical flowcharts from compressing into unreadable thumbnails.
- Removed unnecessary `.mermaid-inner` wrapper — no longer needed with zoom-based approach.
- Updated JavaScript to use `INITIAL_ZOOM` constant for consistent reset behavior.
- Updated "Scaling Small Diagrams" section to use `zoom` instead of `transform: scale()` for consistency.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-02

### Hybrid Architecture Pattern
- New pattern for complex architectures (15+ elements): simple Mermaid overview (5-8 nodes) + CSS Grid cards for details
- Updated "Architecture / System Diagrams" section in SKILL.md with three-tier approach based on complexity
- Reduced max Mermaid node count from 15-20 to 10-12 in `libraries.md`
- Updated Mermaid scaling guidance to recommend hybrid pattern over scaling tricks for complex diagrams

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-01

### Link Styling
- New "Link Styling" section in `css-patterns.md` — never rely on browser default link colors; use accent colors with sufficient contrast

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-01

### Mermaid Layout Direction
- New "Layout Direction: TD vs LR" section in `libraries.md`
- Prefer `flowchart TD` (top-down) over `flowchart LR` (left-to-right) for complex diagrams
- LR spreads horizontally and makes labels unreadable with many nodes
- Rule: use TD for 5+ nodes or any branching; LR only for simple 3-4 node linear flows

### Documentation
- Simplified README: trimmed Usage section, consolidated Install, added Slide Deck Mode section
- Added `/generate-visual-plan` to command table

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-28

### New Prompt Template
- `/generate-visual-plan` — generate visual implementation plans for features and extensions. Produces editorial/blueprint-style HTML pages with problem comparison panels, state machine diagrams, code snippets, edge case tables, and implementation notes. Designed for documenting feature specs before implementation.

### Prose Accent Patterns
Added patterns for use as accent elements within visual pages.

**`css-patterns.md`** — New "Prose Page Elements" section:
- Body text settings (font-size, line-height, max-width for comfortable reading)
- Lead paragraph patterns (larger size, drop cap variants)
- Pull quotes (border-left, centered with quotation mark)
- Section dividers (horizontal rule, ornamental)
- Article hero patterns (centered, editorial)
- Author byline pattern
- Prose-specific anti-patterns

**`libraries.md`** — New "Typography by Content Voice" section:
- Font recommendations by content type (literary, technical, bold, minimal)
- Special mention of Literata for screen reading

**`SKILL.md`** — New sections:
- "Prose Accent Elements" — when to use lead paragraphs, pull quotes, callouts
- "Documentation" — content-to-visual mapping (features→cards, steps→flows, APIs→tables)

### Overflow Fix: List Markers in Bordered Containers
- `css-patterns.md`: New section "List markers overlapping container borders" with three solutions
- Rule of thumb: use `list-style-position: inside` or `padding-left: 2em` for lists in bordered containers

### Mermaid Fixes
- Centering: narrow vertical flowcharts must be centered, not left-aligned
- Scaling: complex diagrams with 10+ nodes render too small — increase fontSize to 18-20px or use CSS scale transform
- Special characters: node labels starting with `/`, `\`, `(`, `{` must be quoted to avoid shape syntax conflicts
- New "Scaling Small Diagrams" section in css-patterns.md
- New "Node Label Special Characters" section in libraries.md

### Code Block Patterns
- `css-patterns.md`: New "Code Blocks" section with:
  - Basic pattern with `white-space: pre-wrap` (critical for preserving line breaks)
  - File header pattern for displaying code with filename
  - Implementation plan guidance: don't dump full files, show structure instead
- `SKILL.md`: New "Implementation Plans" section with structure guidance

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-26

### Anti-Slop Guardrails
- Added explicit "Anti-Patterns (AI Slop)" section to SKILL.md with forbidden patterns
- Removed "Neon dashboard" and "Gradient mesh" from allowed aesthetics — they always produce generic output
- Categorized aesthetics as "Constrained" (safer) vs "Flexible" (use with caution)
- Explicit forbidden fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, system-ui as primary
- Explicit forbidden colors: indigo/violet range (`#8b5cf6`, `#7c3aed`, `#a78bfa`), cyan-magenta-pink combination
- Explicit forbidden effects: gradient text on headings, animated glowing box-shadows, emoji section headers
- Added "The Slop Test" — 7-point checklist to catch AI-generated patterns before delivery
- Strengthened typography guidance with 5 explicit good pairings to use
- Strengthened color guidance with 5 explicit good palettes to use
- Referenced `websocket-implementation-plan.html` as positive example of Blueprint aesthetic

### Template Fixes
- Replaced violet secondary colors in `mermaid-flowchart.html` with sky blue to match anti-slop guidelines
- Updated Mermaid themeVariables example in `libraries.md` to use teal/slate palette instead of violet

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-25

### Slide Deck Mode
- New output format: magazine-quality slide deck presentations as self-contained HTML files
- 10 slide types: Title, Section Divider, Content, Split, Diagram, Dashboard, Table, Code, Quote, Full-Bleed
- SlideEngine JS: keyboard/touch/wheel navigation, progress bar, nav dots, slide counter, keyboard hints with auto-fade
- Cinematic transitions: fade + translateY + scale on slide entrance, staggered child reveals via IntersectionObserver
- 4 curated presets: Midnight Editorial, Warm Signal, Terminal Mono, Swiss Clean (each with full light/dark palette)
- Event delegation: Mermaid zoom, scrollable code/tables don't trigger slide navigation
- Responsive height breakpoints (700px, 600px, 500px) for projection and small viewports
- Typography scale 2–3× larger than scrollable pages (80–120px display, 28–48px headings, 16–24px body)
- Per-slide background variation, SVG decorative accents, compositional variety rules
- Proactive imagery: surf-cli integration for title/full-bleed backgrounds, inline sparklines, mini-charts
- New `/generate-slides` prompt template; existing prompts support `--slides` flag via SKILL.md workflow
- Unified `autoFit()` post-render function: auto-scales Mermaid SVGs, KPI values, and long blockquotes to fit their containers
- Fix Mermaid diagrams rendering tiny in slide containers (flex shrink-wrap + inline max-width)
- Fix KPI card overflow for text values (white-space + transform scale)
- Fix quote slides with long text (proportional font-size reduction)

### Files
- `references/slide-patterns.md` — slide engine CSS, all 10 type layouts, transitions, nav chrome, content density limits, presets
- `templates/slide-deck.html` — reference template demonstrating all 10 types in Midnight Editorial preset
- `prompts/generate-slides.md` — slash command for generating slide decks
- `SKILL.md` — new "Slide Deck Mode" section with slide routing, `--slides` flag detection, visual richness guidance

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-24

- Removed Mermaid `handDrawn` mode — Rough.js hachure fills are hardcoded and render unreadable diagonal scribbles inside nodes with no user-facing override. All diagrams now use `look: 'classic'` with custom `themeVariables` for visual distinction.
- Added `package.json` for `pi install` support — installs the skill and all slash commands in one step instead of `git clone` + manual `cp`

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-24

- Extended `classDef` color warning to also cover per-node `style` directives — both hardcode text color that breaks in the opposite color scheme
- Renamed `.node` card classes to `.ve-card` to fix CSS collision with Mermaid's internal `.node` class that broke diagram layout (PR #7)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-19

- Added sequence diagram syntax guidance to "Writing Valid Mermaid" — curly braces, brackets, and ampersands in message labels silently break rendering

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-19

- Prompts no longer require the `pi-prompt-template-model` extension — each prompt now explicitly loads the skill itself
- Added "Writing Valid Mermaid" section to `libraries.md` (quoting special chars, simple IDs, max node count, arrow styles, pipe escaping)
- Fixed mobile scroll offset in `responsive-nav.md` — section headings now clear the sticky nav bar via `scroll-margin-top`
- Added video preview to README

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-16

Initial release.
